# turbo-text-renamer

The program overwrites all files it finds in the location where it is running. It will change the text you select to another text of your choice. For example email.

⚠⚠⚠ **I would like to warn that if the program is run with parameters like 0 0. Then it will break every file that is in the folder or child folders.** ⚠⚠⚠

Program ignores .exe and .cpp files.

Example: ```program.exe example1@mail.com example2@mail.com```
